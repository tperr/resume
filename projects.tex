Entropy Emulator\\
Objective:} Make a simple emulator for a computer
\begin{itemize}
    \item Program was coded in C++, and includes a non-complex Makefile
    \item Reads in a file consisting of different operations a computer can perform (Clock tick, memory load, CPU load) from command line input, and executes each operation with Assembly like operations along with the computer operations (Load/Save word, branches)
